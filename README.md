## 🎯 What We Do

The VMS User Group brings together researchers, engineers, and practitioners to:

- **Develop** standardised simulation methodologies for manufacturing applications
- **Share** templates, tools, and best practices across the community
- **Collaborate** on cutting-edge research in digital twins and virtual manufacturing
- **Support** knowledge transfer between academia and industry
- **Advance** the field through open-source innovation and peer review
